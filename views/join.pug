        h2 Having a say
        p You get to decide the type of events we put on, the speakers we get in, and help contribute to making the society better. We're a democracy, so your say is just as important as anyone's.

        h2 Exclusive access to events
        p We hold members-only events, such as hackathons, code-challenges, workshops and guest speakers that you'll only be able to attend if you’re a member of the society.
